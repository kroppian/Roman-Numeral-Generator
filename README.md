# Roman-Numeral-Generator
Simple and fun little program that converts roman numerals to arabic decimals. I wrote this a few months back, and I thought the internet world would get a kick out of it. It was hard not to make, since I love Roman history and the Roman numerals are recursive. 

# Basic Usage
To run, install python3 and execute the following:

```
python romanNumeralTranslator.py NUMERAL
```
